ABOUT THE .CFG FILE
----------------------------------
In 99% of all cases, you will not need to touch the .cfg
file. All configuration that you need is passed on the 
command line.

The .CFG file is provided for those BBS's which have
unusual characteristics or require specific customization.
You should not need to worry about altering the .CFG file.

If you do require use of the .CFG file, it must reside
in the same directory as the door's .EXE.

Supported BBS Drop Files:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

DORINFOx.DEF
EXITINFO.BBS
CHAIN.TXT
DOOR.SYS
CALLINFO.BBS
SFDOORS.DAT
  and possibly many others. Just try it. Customizeable drop file is also
  available within the .cfg file.

If your drop file is not on the list, and works, let me know and I'll add
it to the list.

On-Line Sysop Commands
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
While a caller is on-line, the local sysop has several options.  They are
as follows:

Alt: [C]hat [H]angup [L]ockout [J]Dos
[K]eyboard-Off [D]rop to BBS

[UP]/[DOWN] - Use the arrow keys to increase or decrease the
	      amount of time which the user has left in the
	      door.

[Alt]-[C] -   Allows the sysop to break into chat with the user
	      at any time. [Alt]-[C] again, or [ESC] will end
	      chat mode. This function invokes a split screen
	      sysop chat.

[Alt]-[J] -   Allows the sysop to shell to DOS, if enough memory
	      is available. Simply type EXIT to return to the
	      door again. BE SURE TO HIT "R" for REDRAW when
	      returning to the Door.

[Alt]-[H] -   Hang up on the user. When the sysop does this,
	      the program will close files with a safe exit
	      back to your BBS system in "wait for call" mode.

[Alt]-[L] -   This key locks the user out of the BBS. It first
	      hangs up on the user, and then sets their security
	      level to 0, to prevent them from ever logging on
	      again. This feature may require use of the
	      EXITINFO.BBS file, depending on what system the
	      door is running under.

[Alt]-[K] -   The "User Keyboard-Off" key allows the sysop to
	      temporarily prevent the user from typing anything
	      on their keyboard. This has no effect on the local
	      keyboard, but causes the program to ignore any
	      keystrokes from remote.

[Alt]-[N] -   The "Sysop Next" key, this function reserves the
	      system for use by the sysop after the user logs
	      off, if the door is running under an Apex or RA
	      1.00 or later system.

[Alt]-[D] -   "Drop to BBS" key. This function allows the sysop
	      to exit the door and return the user to the BBS,
	      without hanging up.
