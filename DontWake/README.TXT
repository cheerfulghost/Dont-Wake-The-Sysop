1I:

Maintenance release. Uses less memory from the heap.
A lot of internal changes. Uses less hard disk memory for executable.

BUG FIXES FROM 1G TO 1H:

wake maint W
caused a lock up. Monthly was okay. Weekly maintenance is now fixed.

If you viewed scores while you were playing each turn, it would not
replace the high daily score properly. Now fixed.

Sorry. :(
